# Autonomous driving agent and simulator
In this repository there is the autonomous driving agent developed during the "Intelligent vehicles and autonomous driving" course. This agent will be tested using a minimal driving simulator, useful for both high and low level control in the field of self-driving cars.


### Istructions to set python simulator

In the terminal, run the following commands:
```
sudo apt install gcc 
sudo apt install g++ 
sudo apt install clang 
sudo apt install clang++ 
sudo apt install cmake 
sudo apt install gdb 
```

#### To run the visualizator on Windows 10 using WSL:

- Install XLaunch and set "Disable access control", then save this configuration in %AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup folder to avoid to open XLaunch each time

- The next step is to set the DISPLAY environment variable on Linux to use the Windows host's IP address. In the terminal run:
  ```
  export DISPLAY="`grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | sed 's/nameserver //'`:0" 
  ```

- It is possible to see that the $DISPLAY environment variable now has the Windows Hostâ€™s IP set running the following command: 
  ```
  echo $DISPLAY
  ```

- To avoid having to run that command every time that WSL is launched, you can you can paste the command (export DISPLAY..) at the end of the /etc/bash.bashrc file, running: 
  ```
  nano ~/.bashrc or gedit ~/.bashrc
  ```  

- It is also necessary to create a .xsession file in the user's home directory: 
   ```
   echo xfce4-session > ~/.xsession
  ```

- Finally run: 
  ```
  sudo apt-get update
  ```
